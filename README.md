## Getting Help or Contributing

**IMPORANT:** I consider this plugin feature complete and don't spend a lot of time on maintenance due to other time commitments. While, I will eventually get to issues or PRs raised, **do not** expect a timely response. I'm not trying to be rude or dismissive, I only get back to this project periodically (on the order of _months_, in many cases). Please set your expectations appropriately as you file issues or open PRs.

Please use the repo's [issues](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-stutter/issues) for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Why do you care?

When writing a Gradle plugin you often want to run the same suite of tests against all versions you support. The Gradle TestKit gives you the tools to do this, but makes you write the scaffolding for which versions and which tests.

## What is it?

`gradle-stutter` is a [Gradle](http://gradle.org) plugin plugin, `org.ajoberstar.stutter`, which does some common setup for testing Gradle plugins against multiple Gradle versions.

- Extension for specifying Java and Gradle versions that are compatible with your plugin
- Allows specifying different compatible versions for each Java version
- Task to create lock file listing compatible Gradle versions
- Generates a compatibility test task for your suite for each combination of supported Java version and Gradle version
- Uses Gradle's [toolchain](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) feature to run each suite under the appropriate JDK

See [java-gradle-plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html) docs for more details on Gradle's out-of-the-box functionality.

## Usage

See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-stutter/releases) for updates on
changes and compatibility with Java and Gradle versions.

### Applying the Plugin

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'org.ajoberstar.stutter' version '<version>'
}
```

### Configuration

```groovy
stutter {
  // if true, only match min/max within that otherwise matches your compatibility specs in each Gradle major version
  sparse = false // defaults to true

  matrices {
    // a matrix of tests running against Java 8
    java8 {
      javaToolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(8)
      }
      gradleVersions {
        compatibleRange '3.0', '4.0' // include 3.0 <= version < 4.0
        compatibleRange '4.2' // include 4.2 <= version
        compatible '2.14', '1.2' // include 2.14 and 1.12 specifically
        incompatible '3.3' // exclude 3.3 even if included above
      }
    }

    // name can be anything
    jdkNine {
      javaToolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(9)
      }
      gradleVersions {
        compatibleRange '4.0' // include 4.0 <= version
      }
    }
  }

  // You do have to specify compatible Gradle versions for all Java versions you run Gradle with

  // If you have a lot of tests, or otherwise just don't want to test every Gradle version that you say is compatible,
  // use sparse = true. This will greatly limit the number of versions you test against, but should do the job of
  // verifying compatibility.
  // e.g.  compatible '2.14' and compatibleRange '3.0'
  //       matches '2.14', '3.0', '3.5.1', '4.0', '4.7' (presuming 4.7 is the latest available 4.x)
}
```

### Lock file

Lock files will be generated/used from the `<project>/stutter.lockfile` directory.

Lock files are generated with the `stutterWriteLocks` task based on the configuration of the `stutter` extension (see above).

```
./gradlew stutterWriteLocks
```

### Tests

The plugin adds a `compatTest` source set that is configured via `java-gradle-plugin` as the source set for your plugin tests. This means you can leverage `withPluginClasspath` on the `GradleRunner` for your tests. The test kit dependency is **not** added by this plugin.

The following tasks are available:

- One `compatTest<matrix>Gradle<version>` (e.g. `compatTestJava8Gradle7.3.3`) task per supported version (based on the compatible lock file -- see above for details)
- A matrix-level `compatTest<matrix>` (e.g. `compatTestJava8`) task that depends on all specific Gradle versions tasks for that matrix. This allows you to run all of the tests for a given JDK matrix via one convenient task.
- An overall `compatTest` which depends on all of the matrix-level tasks. This allows you to run all tests for all JDKs and Gradle versions.
- `check` does not depend on `compatTest` by default, but you can add a dependency easily

  ```
  tasks.named("check") {
    dependsOn(tasks.named("compatTest"))
  }
  ```

Your tests should reference the `compat.gradle.version` system property when they specify a version on the `GradleRunner`:

```java
GradleRunner.create()
    .withGradleVersion(System.getProperty("compat.gradle.version"))
    //...
```

## Migrating from 0.6.0

- Gradle must be run with Java 11 or higher
- Lock files have moved from `.stutter/` to `stutter.lockfile` (you should delete the `.stutter/` directory)
- `sparse` is now the default, you can still set it to `false` if you prefer
- `check` does not depend on `compatTest` anymore. This gives you more flexibilty as to which tests are run by default.
- Syntax changes in the stutter extension:

From:

```
stutter {
  sparse = true

  java(8) {
    compatibleRange '3.0', '4.0'
    compatibleRange '4.2'
    compatible '2.14', '1.2'
    incompatible '3.3'
  }

  java(9) {
    compatibleRange '4.0'
  }
}
```

To:

```
stutter {
  sparse = true

  matrices {
    java8 {
      javaToolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(8)
      }
      gradleVersions {
        compatibleRange '3.0', '4.0'
        compatibleRange '4.2'
        compatible '2.14', '1.2'
        incompatible '3.3'
      }
    }

    java9 {
      javaToolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(9)
      }
      gradleVersions {
        compatibleRange '4.0'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternatives

### TestKit (out-of-the-box)

[TestKit](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/test_kit.html) is built into Gradle, so it should be your first consideration. It provides a good interface to kick off full test builds and verify the output/tasks that ran. This tends to be a far more effective way to test Gradle plugin code than unit testing, due to the complexity of Gradle.

On top of TestKit, Stutter provides a convenient way to run a test suite against multiple versions of Gradle. This is very useful for verifying compatibility.

### GradleTest

The [org.ysb33r.gradletest](https://github.com/ysb33r/gradleTest) plugin is optimized for creating and testing sample projects without you having to directly interact with TestKit. These can also be tested across multiple versions of Gradle providing helpful compatibility verification. GradleTest also provides the ability to test Gradle versions far older than Stutter does.

Stutter leaves the user to decide how to leverage TestKit, it just helps provide the ability to test multiple versions with the same suite. If your use case is more centered around samples or full project tests, GradleTest may be a better fit.
